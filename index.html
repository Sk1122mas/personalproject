        <h2 id="green"> Reduced Air Quality </h2>
        <p>In Malaysia, The air quality have been heavily impacted. Mostly, the sources of the pollution comes from our
          use of transportation. Since Malaysian citizens often relies on using cars to get around their area, it often
          causes massive traffic and increase of the usage of cars. The exhaust pipe from the multiple cars is the main
          cause of the worsen air quality.
          The worsen air quality would also impact the human health. For example in Johor, the concentration of
          pollutants is PM2.5 as of September 9, 2024. Unfiiting for human health as it is 3.6 times worse than the WHO
          guideline value.
          It also reduce the quality of life, as many people who lived in Malaysia or born in Malaysia have stated that
          there is an unpleasant smell in the air. This poses a threat to people who have respiratory health problems.

        <h2 id="blue"> Environment In Danger </h2>
        <p>Malaysia, ranking 12th globally in its biodiversity, is now facing a devastating situation as the severe
          pollution in the country threatens to endanger the
          environment. For example, toxic wastes dumped into the rivers have affected the marine wildlives and killed
          many fishes, also reducing the amount of fishes that
          fishermen will fish for. Right now, the clean water that Malaysia used to have and has become dirty and
          polluted, almost unsightly and embarrassing to see as a
          Malaysian. Pollution is also the cause of habitat loss in Malaysia.
